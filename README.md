<b>Jvilley- A futuristic wp-magazine-template</b><br/>
Hi folks! We introducing Jvilley, a futuristic magazine template for WordPress sites. We did our best to bring it to the public who needs to create a magazine or a news portal in WordPress. The temlate currently is an HTML5 based. It is highly responsive! And, our mission is to keep the FOSS concepts. As we know, WordPress is a well-known opensource CMS. And, all the web devs who work with WordPress, are deviating from FOSS concepts. There is nothing you can get without money. Yes! there are free templates and modules you can get. But, with a bunch of bugs. Due to those buggy scripts, the security of WordPress is now questionable. Do we want paid workers in an opensource community? No. We don't need them. So, people who wish to work with us, join thus project and we need your help to convert this good looking HTML5 template into a highly customizable WordPress theme. Thank you!
